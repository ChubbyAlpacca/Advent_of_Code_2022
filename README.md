# Advent_of_Code_2022

Problems and solutions completed while practicing on the advent of code 2022! My main focus for '23 is to build upon front end skills (my usual day is Java/Backend work) so why not start now? this is the perfect time to learn and fail!

# To get the answer for a specific day

cd into the day you want (ie day1)
run "node dayOneSolution.js"
enjoy the answer to the problem!

# To run the application

in your terminal cd into "./advent_of_code_app/src"
run "node index.js"
enjoy!

# To run test suite

run npm test from the terminal
